# Best-Classifier
This repository contains a jupyter notebook where I have tried to check which classification model among KNN, DECISION TREE, SVM, LOGISTIC REGRESSION, works best on a data set where the goal is to find out whether a customer who is granted a loan by a particular bank will pay it off or default it. The models are trained and the accuracy of each model is checked on the testing data set using different Evaluation Metrices and reported.
I am providing the data set for training the models and also a data set to test the developed models.
